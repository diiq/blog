Black ice is prowling the streets, knowing the asphalt  
in the way I think I’ll someday I know my own bones.  
The icy roads have brought my bus to an unhappy halt  
and the passengers chorus complaints in brassy tones,  
but I like black ice: it pretends to be water and  
it is rare, among the untouched inanimate, to find  
something so apparently dissatisfied with itself. Sand  
doesn’t yearn to be steel or sapphire — only beach. Mind  
the black ice. Mind anything that’s colder than it looks,  
because however it looks you’re the one who’s wrong.  
In the very end it won’t be the ice waking up with a broken foot.  
So listen; don’t touch, don’t step. Black ice sings her song:  

I am not yours, not wet, not sound, not safe, not soft — not now.  
My nature never lived in eyes, but here, in frozen ground.

Here's a small mental tool that is useful for storytelling and roleplaying but also for moral philosophy and team morale:

Any agent in the world must have some driving motivation, or else it won't do anything at all.

That agent might be you, or a character in a story, or a team of people working together. In this respect "real" agents and fictional ones are no different; "you" are a character you create each day.

Some agent motivations are quite specific: "I want tacos", "I want revenge on the man that killed my pa", "We want to plant a million trees".

If you concentrate too hard on a specific motivation, much of what goes on around you may seem irrelevant; 99% of life is moving you neither towards nor away from tacos. It's mostly taco-neutral stuff happening out there. Being blinded to the opportunities around you as a person or as a team can be very limiting; in writing or improvising a character, it can be totally damning.

A global motivation is one that almost always applies, no matter the situation. "I want to stimulate my mind and body with pleasurable physical experiences" is a mouthful, but it can lead not only to tacos but also ski trips and walks in the woods and all sorts of other things. In any given situation, a hedonist with that motivation can declare a preference for one course of action over another.

A character who wants eye-for-an-eye fairness in all things will want to kill the man who killed their pa, but will *also* have urgent reasons to act in situations that have no relation to their father.

Some made-up vocabulary:
- A specific (or local) motivation only offers guidance in a limited set of circumstances.
- A general (or global) motivation offers guidance in almost any set of circumstances.

This is a spectrum, obviously. But dichotomies are useful tools for thinking if they offer interesting vocabulary, as long as I am careful not to stab myself with them. When writing a character, improvising a scene, plumbing your own moral depths, or assembling a team, if you seek out a global motivation, then you will be able to see reason for action even in unforeseen circumstances.

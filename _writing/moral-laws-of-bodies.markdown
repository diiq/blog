2.  You should be allowed and encouraged to change your body, if you like.
3.  You should be able to open a book, read a newspaper, watch TV or go to the movies, and occasionally see someone who looks like you; and they should be shown as a real, complex person, worthy of attention, love, respect, and all other human dignities.

### II. Other People’s Bodies

1.  You should be allowed to find people’s bodies attractive; but politely keep it to yourself if they’re not interested.
2.  You should be allowed to be curious about other people’s bodies; but politely keep it to yourself if your curiosity seems unwelcome.
3.  You should be allowed to find other people’s bodies repulsive. Politely keep it to yourself.

### III. The Interaction of Bodies

1.  If everyone can consent and has consented and is consenting, then it is permissible.
2.  If you become uncomfortable, you should be able to stop.
3.  No matter the circumstances, no one owes your body any attention beyond the civilities outlines in parts I and II.

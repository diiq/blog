Ride a bike. Pick the narrowest stripe on the cement, and imagine that it is a narrow, foot-wide bridge between two tall buildings. Imagination is critical; know what the buildings look like, how high you are, how far you have to go. Be sure of these things.

It is frightening, up there on the windy bridge attempting not to die. To stay calm, pretend that you’re on the ground, perfectly safe. Imagine the street, the grass, and pretend you’re trying to bike in a straight line just for fun. Be sure of these things.

When you feel a little jerk in your heart, you’re getting it right. If you pull the brake, or swerve, you’ve achieved the goal. Die nobly.

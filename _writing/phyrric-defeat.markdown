A poem wants me writing it  
a bad-ass dancer of a poem  
a cool boy that can look good in sunglasses  
but he insists he’s all pyrrhic feet  
toes akimbo and not one stress among ‘em.  
My boy don’t believe in stress.  
(when the in the of the or the though)  
But my hands are still luke-warm  
and my bones aren’t ready for the soup  
at least I hope has me not  
so every line finds some emphasumph  
and cool boy tosses down his cigarette  
and finds someone else to fuck.

Tunes and truths tell he’s gone away  
but I follow him, and leave songs and truth behind me  
he prefers to travel light  
worn out shoes and worn out ideas and worn leather jacket I found in dad’s closet  
I like crowds with purpose  
but my poem just jostles for the contact  
shoulders rub and laughter comes from somewhere behind me.  
I try to grasp his beltloop, to keep track of him,  
but even when I rub the paper between my fingers I lose my grip.  
cool boy with the cold dead feet takes his toe-tags with him  
and I’m stuck in this dumb people pudding.

It happens night after night  
he comes, and I rub my cotton-eyed face,  
still uncertain I made it home the night before  
and he looks me in the eye like  
an ampersand, all full on both sides.  
I know there must be light in the counters  
because people make sense of their drink orders  
he’s holding a glass  
but only when he needs it  
and I never saw him pay  
he doesn’t dance, not with those feet  
but he does move

Some people fall on the beat  
and some people syncopate  
and I jerk off like a puppet  
but he moves on every beat, and the ones between  
and all the ones between  
a smooth analog second hand keeping time  
only in relation to marks on the face of the afternoon  
never pausing himself  
rolling past the whole ticktocking stage set.  
I think the band keeps time with their fingers  
and the drummer closes his eyes  
to defend their senses from mister analog  
my monotone boy.  
Hell, I know they do.  
I do it too. Every metaphor is a sorry shield  
a mirror between me and my medusa  
He was born stone-faced, of course,  
but he’ll never get cancer, no matter how many cigarettes  
and when I look him in the face it’s all on me  
he only lets me get that close when he knows I’m naked,  
and I try to scramble for a pen  
to write down that my teeth are hollow  
filled with sore pink flesh  
to scream that I can feel the sharp edges and push my tongue up inside  
to shiver and cry in the shit-stinking terror of it  
so that even he seems phased, or maybe I just looked so hard  
he seems to pause while the image fades  
my vision more persistent than I want to be.  
I’m afraid of him, most nights  
afraid of his dead feet and those hollow teeth  
and the sea-things that live inside them  
I guess he still goes to parties  
I hear he’s a fury now  
but when I go to the bars,  
he’s never there  
no, nor his mysterious drink  
and I babble  
and nobody listens  
that maybe a poem wanted me once.

We call things "tools" in a lot of contexts; there are tools for physical work, tools for mental work, for office work, for technical work, and tools for teamwork.
There are so many things in our lives that get that label that sometimes damaging ideas sneak in by wearing a tool-shaped trenchcoat.

To be a tool, something must accomplish one of these three transformations of a task:

- Transform work that required many people into one that requires a fraction as many. These are tools like a skid steer or a design system. In military contexts this kind of tool is called a "force multiplier" --- if what required a force of 10 people now only requires 5, the tool is a 2x force multiplier.
- Transform hard work for one person into easy work for one person. These are tools like a chainsaw or a targeted single-use library. They're not quite force multipliers, because a task can never use half a person; but a hard task leaves you exhausted, and an easy task leaves you ready for more.
- Transform impossible work into possible work. These are tools like calculus, a welder, or Unreal Engine. Before Leibniz and Newton invented calculus, there were problems which were impossible to solve but can now be solved by a motivated high schooler.

Every one of these tools requires initial expense, education, and ongoing maintenance; they are worth the cost because they are tools by one of the above three definitions. Things that look and sound like tools but don't actually make hard work easier are not tools, they're mistakes. **Don't introduce complications to your team unless they're actually tools.**

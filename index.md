**My name is Sam Bleckley.** I'm a software engineer, designer, and artist, working out of Grand Rapids, Michigan.

At work, I build complex, user-facing software like [Vistimo](https://www.vistimo.com) for clients and for my own business. You can see some of my code on [github](https://github.com/diiq), or check out my work life on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-bleckley/). When I play, I draw, read, write, play the banjo, build things, hike, and drive my 1959 Austin Healey Sprite.

The opinions I express here one day are not guaranteed to be my opinions the next day; I am still learning new things every day. Sometimes I remove old posts when they become too alien to who I am today.

I love to meet new people. Chat with me on twitter [@diiq](https://twitter.com/diiq), or send me an email [s@diiq.org](mailto:s@diiq.org).
